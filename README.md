## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alan, an experienced developer with past team lead and CTO experience. I am most familiar with front end technologies, but also not scared to dip into php and nodeJS. I'm currently looking for my next role, so do reach out! In the meantime I'll be enhancing my usage of AI code assistants and my ability to work on backend / fullstack solutions.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Researching / Working On - Iâ€™m currently working on a quick 'Baby Name Match' app with Clause Code to test AI/Vibe coding potential
- ðŸŒ± Learning - Iâ€™m currently learning LLMs, AI and further backend technologies such as nodeJS
- ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration - Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that can enhance my FullStack experience
